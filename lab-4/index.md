This project is a web application developed using Express and Node.js. It showcases a simple yet functional interface
for managing movie information, including operations like viewing, adding, editing, and deleting movie entries. Tailored
with a responsive design, it leverages Pug as the template engine and TailwindCSS for styling, offering a seamless user
experience across different devices.

## Insights and Results

Throughout the development of this project, I learned about the integration of various technologies such as Express,
MongoDB, SQLite, and TailwindCSS. One of the challenges faced was ensuring responsive design, which was addressed using
TailwindCSS. Another challenge was managing asynchronous database operations, for which async/await syntax in Node.js
proved to be invaluable.
