# ITMD542-S24

Welcome to the ITMD542-S24 project! This project is an assignment project for my IIT Study 542 course.

## Project Overview

This project aims to showcase my course assignments and academic progress.

You can click on the links below and then view the information on each lab's published page.

## Lab1 - [Link](lab-1)

Lab1 is our course's first task, and it includes the following:

- Create an index.html file in the root of your repository. Create a webpage as the into/landing page of your
  repository. This page should be an intro to the class and you. Eventually you will link other pages to this page. Add
  a CSS file and add CSS to this page. You can do whatever you want as a design but make it look the best you can.
- Commit your files to your repository and GitHub often. I expect to see more than one commit for this work.

Please visit the Lab1 [Link](lab-1) to see more details.

## Lab2 - [Link](lab-2)

Lab2 tasks students with building a Node JS Express app for a non-persistent contact database, focusing on CRUD
operations. Key elements include:

- Express-generator for setup, Git for versioning without node_modules, optional template engine preference for
  Pug, and CRUD functionalities without an actual databaseâ€”instead, using a JSON file for data handling.
- Contacts include ID, name, email (optional), notes (optional), and timestamps. The app requires form
  validation, sanitization, RESTful URL patterns, and POST for data changes.

## Lab3 - [Link](lab-3)

Lab3 Convert Lab 2 Node.js Express App to SQLite

- Use any Node SQLite module for database interactions.
- Data file must be stored in the project's data folder.
- Ensure the app functions by cloning the repository to a new location and testing.

Lab 4: Node.js Express Movie Database with MongoDB Atlas

- Develop a Node.js Express app for CRUD operations on a movie database using MongoDB Atlas.
- Include RESTful routing, Pug templating, CSS styling, and dotenv for credential protection.
- Submit with incremental git commits, a detailed README, and adhere to the due date and submission guidelines.

## Final Project - [Link](final-project)

Develop a unique full stack CRUD application, integrating Node.js, Express, and MongoDB or SQLite. Focus on originality,
avoiding common examples like contact or todo apps.

- Implementation: Use Node.js with Express for backend, HTML templates for frontend, and MongoDB Atlas or SQLite for the
  database. Ensure professional styling and secure credentials with dotenv.
- Features: Include authentication (PassportJS), protected routes, at least two data models, and support for all CRUD
  operations.
- Submission: Maintain a private GitHub repository with regular commits. Provide a README with setup and testing
  instructions. Submit before finals week.
