# ITMD542-S24

Welcome to the ITMD542-S24 project! This project is an assignment project for my IIT Study 542 course.

## Project Overview

This project aims to showcase my course assignments and academic progress.
You can click on the links below and then view the information on each lab's published page.

## Lab1 - [Link](lab-1/index.html)

Lab1 is our course's first task, and it includes the following:

- Create an index.html file in the root of your repository. Create a webpage as the into/landing page of your
  repository. This page should be an intro to the class and you. Eventually you will link other pages to this page. Add
  a CSS file and add CSS to this page. You can do whatever you want as a design but make it look the best you can.
- Commit your files to your repository and GitHub often. I expect to see more than one commit for this work.

Please visit the Lab1 [Link](lab-1/index.html) to see more details.
